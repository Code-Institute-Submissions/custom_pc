                            Perhaps the most common complaint of all when it comes to buying a new computer, whether it’s a laptop, desktop or even a smartphone, is that they tend to come installed with loads of useless junk software. In fact, one of the first things most experts
                            recommend to those who have just purchased a new computer is to spend a few hours cleaning it of all the off-the-shelf junk. From so-called antivirus and PC “optimization” software plagued by nag screens to unwanted trial and
                            demo versions of other programs and games, bloatware has become a serious problem. However, when you assemble your own computer, you’ll start with a completely blank hard drive and only a retail copy of windows (or any other
                            operating system).

                            When you buy a pre-built computer from a retailer, it usually comes with a warranty that lasts for a year or so, they may also include technical support. This sort of warranty would typically cover the entire computer as a whole, which may sound nice
                            but it may end up being an inconvenient to you if a part in your system malfunctions. You typically need to send your machine in for a repair or wait for the company to send you a technician which leaves you without a computer
                            in both scenarios.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, if you buy your components separately for a custom build, you would realise that these pieces have warranty options that last for two or even more as opposed to the one year you get with a pre-built system. Some high-quality components are shipped
                            with warranties that last for five or even seven years with some components even coming with lifetime guarantees.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another major issue with a pre-built system is that, upgrading your machine could void your warranty as it’s treated as unnecessary tinkering by the manufacturer. Furthermore, the components that your machine come with may not be suitable for upgrading.
                            For example, the motherboard on such machines usually come with only two ram slots, so increasing your ram mean replacing the motherboard and possibly the CPU depending how old the build is.

                            Building your PC means you have total control as a builder. You can select the parts based on exactly what you want or need and doing this also allows for easy changes down the road. You may consider your PC as an ever changing and ever growing process.
                            Maybe right now you may only want to do some casual gaming on the side and not care for the highest quality graphics. However, in a few years, you may be a gaming fanatic and in need of a better graphics card or wonder off
                            into the realms of video editing and find yourself short of processing power. In any case, instead of buying an entirely new system, you can just swap couple of the core components in your machine.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, if you wish to go down the gaming route, then you would naturally invest in a powerful GPU, a fast SSD and a high refresh rate monitor or even a 4k monitor depending on what type of game you want to play. If you find yourself craving for
                            more processing power, you could opt in for a more powerful multithreaded CPU instead with more ram.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One other issue with pre-built systems is that, you are stuck with whatever generic configuration that is offered by the retailer and finding exactly what you are looking for will be a challenge. However, with custom PCs you have the flexibility to experiment
                            with different builds and ultimately create exactly what you were looking for.

                            Whether you are a student or an adult in the workforce, building a PC gives you an advantage over those who have not built their own computer. If you put 100 people in a room and ask how many of them can build a computer, I can guarantee that a small
                            percentage would raise their hand. We live in an era where computers are everywhere we go; they are in businesses, households, cars, and even in our pockets.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Understanding how these machines are put together is an important life skill. If your computer has problems, you can fix it yourself. Maybe your parents, friends, children, or other relatives are having computer trouble too. Rather than spending thousands
                            of pounds to replace it, they can call you over, and you can help diagnose and fix it yourself. Having the ability to build and fix a computer can benefit you for the rest of your life. These life skills can help you save time
                            and money, which gives you an advantage over everyone else who doesn’t have those skills.

                            When you build your own PC, you will purchase the individual component based on your needs. If you determine that a particular part isn’t performing to your liking, or if you decide you want an upgrade, replacing the part is a simple process. However,
                            upgrading the components on a pre-built store-bought machine will in many cases void your machine’s warranty with manufacturer and it can quite difficult if you have never built your own computer, you may not be comfortable
                            enough to perform the upgrades yourself, which will force you to pay more to have someone make the upgrades for you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Upgrading the parts on your custom-built PC is cheaper and it’s often as simple as removing the component in question and replacing it with the upgraded component. As an avid gamer it is always a good idea to update your system every few years.

                            When you buy a pre-built machine, you are stuck with whatever operating system is on that machine. Just because a company comes out with a new operating system, it does not mean that it’s the best one on the market. Often, these new systems have plenty
                            of glitches and other problems.
                        </p>

                            If you build your own PC, you don’t have any restrictions with this problem. You can install multiple operating systems on your machine without having to worry about voiding your warranty. You aren’t forced to run the new Windows 10; instead, you can
                            install whatever operating system you feel most comfortable using. You won’t be forced to upgrade to a different system unless you want to, and you can always go back if you are unhappy with the new software.

                            One of the biggest benefits of building your own personal computer from the ground up is that you can invest in the exact type of machine that you want. You won’t need to worry about overpaying for an insanely powerful computer when its main use is
                            going to be browsing the net with the occasional word processing on the side. You simply won’t need a powerful processor or an expensive high performance power-hungry PSU.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The same logic applies to gaming, as different games or gamers require different specs. You might be a casual gamer; hence it wouldn’t make sense to buy an expensive GPU, or even a high threaded CPU for that matter. A mid-range GPU paired up with one
                            of the high street's cheap popular quadcore CPUs will be more than capable of running all your games at full HD resolution without so much as a hiccup.

                            Assembling your own PC also allows you to future-proof your machine. Upgrading doesn’t necessarily mean having to replace every single component in your system, in fact, the power supply unit, case, monitor and the other peripherals such as mouse and
                            keyboard don’t require upgrading for a long time. Having put together your own PC, the next time you decide to upgrade, you would only need to replace the core components of your machine depending on your specific needs. For
                            example, you may want to replace your graphics card every 3-4 years but your power supply unit and monitor would still be fit for purpose until they give out.
